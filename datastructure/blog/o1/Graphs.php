# level-order traverse (breadth-first) â€“ process the current node, then process all sibling
# nodes before traversing nodes on the next level.
# 
# The general algorithm looks like this:
# 
# 1. Create a queue
# 2. Enqueue the root node and mark it as visited
# 3. While the queue is not empty do:
#   3a. dequeue the current node
#   3b. if the current node is the one we're looking for then stop
#   3c. else enqueue each unvisited adjacent node and mark as visited
#
# Can store a graph either in an Adjacency List or an Adjacency Matrix
# Adjacency lists are more space-efficient, particularly for sparse graphs in which most 
# pairs of vertices are unconnected, while adjacency matrices facilitate quicker lookups.

# better to define as classes not arrays, like:
class GraphNode {
  protected $adjacent = []; //instances of GraphNode
}
// need this because not necessarily all nodes aro interconnected
class Graph {
  protected $nodes = []; //instances of GraphNode
}

# Adjacency List:
$graph = array(
  'A' => array('B', 'F'),
  'B' => array('A', 'D', 'E'),
  'C' => array('F'),
  'D' => array('B', 'E'),
  'E' => array('B', 'D', 'F'),
  'F' => array('A', 'E', 'C'),
);

# Adjacency Matrix:
$graphMatrix1 = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
];

$graphMatrix2 = [
    "A" => ["A" => 0, "B" => 1, "C" => 0, "D" => 0, "E" => 0, "F" => 1],
