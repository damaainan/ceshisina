# purecss-zigario
Retro poster, illustrated in CSS

An ongoing series in which I create art using only CSS and HTML.

Rules I have for myself:

1. All elements must be typed out by hand
2. Only Atom text editor and Chrome Developer Tools allowed.
3. ~~SVG use is limited, and all shapes can only use hand-plotted coordinates and bezier curves - without the aid of any graphics editor.~~
(Note: at one point I was using one or two SVG elements but I eventually grew tired of them and they've since been deleted, so this rule no longer applies. No offense to SVG.)

Because of the artistic nature of this project I have not concerned myself with cross-browser-compatibility, so the live preview will most likely look laughable in anything other than chrome.
