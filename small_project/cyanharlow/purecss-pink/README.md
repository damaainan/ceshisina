Pure CSS Pink

An ongoing series in which I create art using only CSS and HTML.

Rules I have for myself:

1. All elements must be typed out by hand
2. Only Atom text editor and Chrome Developer Tools allowed.
3. No SVG allowed (no offense to SVG)

Because of the artistic nature of this project I have not concerned myself with cross-browser-compatibility, so the live preview will most likely look laughable in anything other than chrome.
